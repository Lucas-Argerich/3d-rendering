# 3D Rendering Playground - Learning Project

Welcome to my 3D Rendering Playground project! ðŸš€

## Overview

This project serves as my personal playground to explore and learn about 3D rendering and game development using vanilla TypeScript without any external libraries or frameworks. As a newcomer to the world of 3D graphics, I aim to experiment with various rendering techniques, build a simple 3D game, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **3D Rendering Exploration:** Learn the fundamentals of 3D graphics rendering, including coordinate systems, transformations, and shading techniques.
2. **Game Development Skills:** Develop a basic 3D game using object-oriented programming principles, incorporating custom rendering and basic game mechanics.
3. **JavaScript & TypeScript Proficiency:** Strengthen my JavaScript and TypeScript skills through hands-on implementation of 3D rendering algorithms and game logic.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to keep the code organized and maintainable. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the canvas element where the 3D scene will be rendered.
* `app.ts`: The entry point of the application, setting up the canvas, initializing the game loop, and handling user input.
* `math`: Contains utility functions and classes for vector and matrix operations required for 3D transformations.
* `models`: Houses 3D models and assets to be used in the scene.
* `shaders`: Contains custom shader code (e.g., vertex and fragment shaders) for handling basic lighting and shading.
* `textures`: Stores texture images used to enhance the appearance of 3D objects.
* `utils`: Contains helper functions and utilities for general purposes.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally and explore the 3D rendering playground:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the console and run the command `npm run dev`.
3. Explore the codebase in the different directories mentioned above to understand how 3D rendering is implemented.

## Contribution and Feedback

Since this project is primarily for learning purposes, contributions and feedback are more than welcome! If you notice any bugs, have suggestions for improvement, or want to share valuable insights related to 3D rendering and game development, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
